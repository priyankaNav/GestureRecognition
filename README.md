# GestureRecognition

->Model 1 gave us **test accuracy of 95% and validation accuracy of 93%** using all the 30 frames.

->While i did try model lesser frames by using even frames but felt more comfortable using full frame. Cropping and other preprocessing also did not affect much on the final accuracy. Same was with hybrid CNN + LSTM model
